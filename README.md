AngularJS_Samples
=================

This is a sample application I created using some help from this site...(thanks)...

http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2010/12/11/javascript-analog-clock-with-no-images-and-no-css/

On the RaphaelJS Clock and a angular free running clock with the connections to the clock hands.

Should be able to just download the applicaion and run Clock.html in WebStorm or any browser.

More to come....
