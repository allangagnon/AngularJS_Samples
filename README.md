AngularJS_Samples
=================

This is a sample application I created.

On the RaphaelJS Clock and a angular free running clock with the connections to the clock hands.

The angularjs sample code is from a very good book I am reading called "ng-book The complete book on AngularJS".

Should be able to just download the applicaion and run Clock.html in WebStorm or any browser.

More to come....
